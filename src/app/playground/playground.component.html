<h2>Learning Directives</h2>

<hr />

<!-- As such, style is not a directive but a property binding -->
<!-- Usage: [style.x]="expression" -->

  This is a paragraph 1
</p>

<!-- 
    Note: Although redundant, It is possible to use ngStyle and style.x 
    Styles are applied in the order and the last style wins in case of conflict.
